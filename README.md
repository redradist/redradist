I worked for a long time the follwing areas:
1) Embedded Electronics (I have master degree in Radio Electronics)

I am interested in learning programming languages, currently know at good level the followling languages: C/C++, Python, Java, C#, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript.
One of my goal is with the knowledge of all these languages to build a new one ([DragonLang](https://github.com/redradist/DragonLang) as example where I am looking at)

Also I am very pasiant about Neural Networks, Embedded Electronics (Smart Home Assistants), Mobile Applications, Web and etc. Acctually in all programming at once =)
